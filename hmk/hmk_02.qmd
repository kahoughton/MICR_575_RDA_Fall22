## Homework #2

Chunk out the messages when a package is loaded.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

The rest of the homework

```{r}
a <- 103

b <- 3

a > b 

ls()

rm(list=ls())

ls()

```

## Question 4: why rm(list = ls()) works

-   **rm()** will remove objects from a specified environment.
-   **list** argument in rm function provides the specific location for objects to be removed
-   **ls()** function will list all the objects in an environment that we want removed \*outcome = cleared all objects in global environment

## Search Function

How R uses search paths to find objects. This is a function in "base" R that will return a list of packages.

```{r}
search()
```
