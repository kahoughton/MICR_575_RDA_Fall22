## Homework \#2

Chunk out the messages when a package is loaded.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

The rest of the homework

``` r
a <- 103

b <- 3

a > b 
```

    [1] TRUE

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "a" "b"

``` r
rm(list=ls())

ls()
```

    character(0)

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed).
