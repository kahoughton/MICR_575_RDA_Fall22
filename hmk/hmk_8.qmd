# Q1: Summarizing operations and exploratory data analysis

## Q1a

Download `experiment1.csv` from Canvas (under files). This reports two variables from an experiment that has four treatments. Creatively, the treatments are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the two variables are `x` and `y`.

Create a data frame that contains the mean, standard deviation, and number of points for each treatment. You will want to use functions like `summarise()`, `group_by()`, `mean()`, and `sd()`.

Are the data sets different in any important way?

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)


```

## Q1b

Now load the file `experiment2.csv`. Again, this describes two variables for multiple treatments (here called `dataset`). Answer the same questions as above.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)


```

# Q2: pivoting

Create a plot that illustrates the differences in income among religions, using the `relig_income` data set that is built into tidyverse.

You will need to create a tidy data frame to do this.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)


```

# Q3: merging

## Q3a: meaning of joins

Explain the difference between a left join, a right join, an inner join, and an outer join.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)


```

## Q3b: using joins

Using the `flights` and `weather` data sets from `nycflights13`, determine whether there is a correlation between average hourly wind speed and departure delays at NY airports.

This is a question about joins: you will need to join the `flights` and `weather` by year, month, day, and hour. However, note that `flights` has encoded departure time in a particularly annoying way: as an integers. For instance, the integer 517 indicates 5:17 am.

`weather` gives average weather conditions each hour, with the hour given as an integer (e.g., 5 indicating 5-6 am). You're going to have to figure out how to convert the time in `flights` into a form that matches the form in `weather`.

If you want, you can use the `lm()` function to make a linear model of departure delay as a function of wind speed. But it is also fine to just make a plot of the two variables with `geom_smooth()`.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)


```
